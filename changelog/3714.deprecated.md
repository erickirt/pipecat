- Deprecated `set_model()`, `set_voice()`, and `set_language()` on AI services in favor of runtime updates via `TTSUpdateSettingsFrame`, `STTUpdateSettingsFrame`, and `LLMUpdateSettingsFrame`.

  ⚠️ Note, too, a subtle behavior change in these deprecated methods. Whereas previously only `set_language()` caused the service to actually react to the update (e.g. by reconnecting to a remote service so it an pick up the change), now all these methods do. This change was made as part of a refactor making them all work the same way under the hood.
