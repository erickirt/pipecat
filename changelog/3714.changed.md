- ⚠️ Refactored runtime-updatable service settings to use strongly-typed classes (`TTSSettings`, `STTSettings`, `LLMSettings`, and service-specific subclasses) instead of plain dicts. Each service's `_settings` now holds these strongly-typed objects. For service maintainers, see changes in COMMUNITY_INTEGRATIONS.md.
