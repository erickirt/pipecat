- Deprecated `ProcessingMetricsData` and `start_processing_metrics()`/`stop_processing_metrics()` on `FrameProcessor` and `FrameProcessorMetrics`. These metrics don't accurately depict a service's performance. Instead, TTFB metrics are recommended. Processing metrics will be removed in the 1.0.0 version.
