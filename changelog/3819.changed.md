- `ServiceSettingsUpdateFrame`s are now `UninterruptibleFrame`s. Generally speaking, you don't want a user interruption to prevent a service setting change from going into effect. Note that you usually don't use `ServiceSettingsUpdateFrame` directly, you use one of its subclasses:
  - `LLMUpdateSettingsFrame`
  - `TTSUpdateSettingsFrame`
  - `STTUpdateSettingsFrame`
